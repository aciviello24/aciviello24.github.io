<h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
<p> This is the webpage I made for the first assignment in CSC 106. 
    This website consists of a banner and three buttons! 
    You can navigate to three pages within my website including an About Me page, 
    a Javascript page, and the Home page (you’re here now!). 
    I hope you enjoy my website and I’m excited to add more to it soon.</p>
